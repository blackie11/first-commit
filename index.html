         <h3>A co-founder at one of the world's largest communities.</h3>
      
         <p>The combined experience i have working at the  top fortune 500 companies has allowed me to develop a skillset that helps me in not just development, but in every aspect of any business.
          </p>
      

         <p>i'm proud to announce that i am now working at one of the world's largest communities teaching young minds about how to sell yourself as a developer and open them to a whole new world of opportunities.

          mean  
         </p>

          
         <p>
           "How big would you dream, if you <strong>knew</strong> you wouldn't fail?''
            You've already gone through the hardest parts of being a developer, it's time to elevate your skills and become a leader in something you're <em>passionate</em> about.
         </p>
          <p>I'm happy to chat over coffee some time about   how i can help your company.
